Welcome to the Happiness wiki! Here are some ways to live a Happy Life. Our Life is mostly hectic everyday. Waking up early in the morning, rushing to work, and getting home late after work and back to bed. In this busy life, people don't think of their and their loved ones happiness. You don't need time to be happy everyday. You can smile while waking up. You can smile when you rush to your "busy, important, sometimes hectic" work. All you have to do is make yourself laugh and even people around you. Being Happy is way better than making others Happy. But in this concept you don't have choice to select either one. You can select both. Hence Your life will be as easy as your dream life.
